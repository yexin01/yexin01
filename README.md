## Hello world! :)

I'm a third-year student at Politecnico di Milano, pursuing my studies in IT engineering. 
So far, I've had the opportunity to work on various exciting projects that have helped me expand my skills and knowledge.

+ [Final project](https://github.com/yexin01/ing-sw-2023-ye-rossi-rondi-russo) for *Ingegneria del Software* 2023 course, where I'm developing a Java-based application.
This project has provided me with valuable hands-on experience in software development methodologies, design patterns, and testing.

+ Final project for *Reti Logiche* 2023 course, focusing on digital logic design using VHDL. This project allowed me to dive into the world of logical circuits and gain insights into hardware description languages.

+ Working on a web application project for *Tecnologie Informatiche del web* 2023 course, which I implemented in two versions.
The first version was built using [pure HTML](https://github.com/polve99/TIW-project-2023-pure-HTML-Polverini-Ye), CSS, and Java, while the second version [RIA](https://github.com/polve99/TIW-project-2023-RIA-Polverini-Ye) incorporated JavaScript alongside the aforementioned web technologies.

<sub>The repositories are still private for courses regolamentations for which i must wait a year after the mark to publish it.</sub>


Through these projects, I have acquired a comprehensive understanding of front-end development, back-end integration, and database management.

I'm passionate about technology and always eager to explore new areas within the realm of engineering. Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories to learn more about my projects and the skills I've developed along the way.
